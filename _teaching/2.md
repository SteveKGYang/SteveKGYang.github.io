I'm so excited that I will be joining national centre for text mining (NaCTeM), University of Manchester in late 2021, for a Master of Philosophy degree. 
I will be under the supervision of Prof. Sofia Ananiadou, who is very pofessional but easy-going. I will be focusing on emotion related NLP tasks.
