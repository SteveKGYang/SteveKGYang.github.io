Hi, I'm Kailai, an undergraduate student from Harbin Institute of Technology. I major in computer science and natural language processing in School of Computer Science. I'm expected to graduate in June, 2021, then to pursue a Master of Philosophy (Engineering) degree in the University of Sydney, Australia. I will be joining [USYDNLP](https://usydnlp.info/) group and co-supervised by Dr. Josiah Poon and Dr. Caren Han. After that, I hope to continue pursuing a PhD degree in Computer Science.

My research interests mainly lie in natural language processing. I'm most interested in reearch dialogue systems, ways to make them more huamn-like, such as persona-based techniques and emotion-sensitive methods. I did research about persona-based dialogue systems as a research assistant in the University of California, Irvine, under the supervision of [Prof. Ian Harris](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~harris/). I'm now focusing on emotion recognition in conversation for my graduation project.

In my spare time I love playing basketball, watching movies and hip-hop.
