Hi, I'm Kailai, a Master of Philosophy candidate from the University of Manchester, UK. I focus on computer science and natural language processing in [NaCTeM](http://nactem.ac.uk/) group and  supervised by Prof. [Sofia Ananiadou](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/sophia.ananiadou.html) and Prof. [Junichi Tsujii](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/profile.php?member=jtsujii). After that, I hope to continue pursuing a PhD degree in computer science. I obtained my BEng degree in Computer Science from Harbin Institute of Technology, China.

My research interests mainly lie in natural language processing. I'm most interested in dialogue systems and ways to make them more human-like, such as persona-based techniques and emotion-sensitive methods. That's why I'm now focusing on emotion recognition in conversation, including knowledge introduction to ERC and conversation modelling.

In my spare time I love playing basketball, watching movies and hip-hop.
