<font size=4>Hi, I'm Kailai, a second-year PhD candidate (President's Doctoral Scholar Awardee) in the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a>, UK. I focus on computer science and natural language processing in <a href="http://nactem.ac.uk/">NaCTeM</a> group. I'm supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/sophia.ananiadou.html">Sophia Ananiadou</a> and Prof. <a href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk/profile.php?member=jtsujii">Junichi Tsujii</a>. I obtained my BEng degree in Computer Science and Technology from <a href="http://en.hit.edu.cn/">Harbin Institute of Technology</a>, China.<br/><br/>

My research interests mainly lie in natural language processing. I'm most interested in dialogue systems and ways to make them more human-like, such as persona-based techniques and emotion-sensitive methods. I'm now focusing on conversational affective computing, especially knowledge infusion methods and conversation modelling.<br/><br/>

I also love the game of basketball (a Boston Celtics fan) and movies (a huge sci-fi fan).</font><br/>
