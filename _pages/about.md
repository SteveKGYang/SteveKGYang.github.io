<font size=4>Hi, I'm Kailai, currently a Postdoc researcher at the University of Manchester. I obained my Ph.D. degree as President's doctoral scholar at <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">The University of Manchester</a> and the <a href="http://nactem.ac.uk/">NaCTeM</a> group in Oct. 2025. During PhD, I had the most enjoyable collaboration with Prof. Jun'ichi Tsujii and Prof. Sophia Ananiadou. I also spent a wonderful time working with talented researchers from Microsoft Research, Baidu Search Science, and AIST, Japan.<br/><br/>

My research mainly lies in natural language processing. I'm now interested in the latest development in large language models. I'm working on aligning LLMs to human preferences and values. I'm also exploring efficient pre-training data mixing methods for foundation models to generally leverage their power. My previous works focus on affective computing and AI for mental health.<br/><br/>

I also enjoy the game of basketball, reading, and movies. I'm a huge sci-fi fan. Reach out if you are interested in collaboration or just want to have a nice chat! : )<br/><br/>
