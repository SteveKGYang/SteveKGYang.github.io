Hi, I'm Kailai, an undergraduate student from Harbin Institute of Technology, China. I major in computer science and natural language processing in Faculty of Computing. I'm expected to graduate in late June, 2021, then to pursue a Master of Philosophy degree in University of Manchester, UK. I will be joining [NaCTeM](http://nactem.ac.uk/) group and  supervised by Prof. [Sofia Ananiadou](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/sophia.ananiadou.html) and Prof. [Junichi Tsujii](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/profile.php?member=jtsujii). After that, I hope to continue pursuing a PhD degree in computer science.

My research interests mainly lie in natural language processing. I'm most interested in dialogue systems and ways to make them more human-like, such as persona-based techniques and emotion-sensitive methods. That's why I'm now focusing on emotion recognition in conversation, including knowledge introduction to ERC and conversation modelling.

In my spare time I love playing basketball, watching movies and hip-hop.
